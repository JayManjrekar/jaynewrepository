Creative Commons is a public copyright license that a creator uses when they want to give others the right to use their work.

Many Wikipedia images, for example, fall under a Creative Commons license. Creative Commons provides six levels of licensing that you can read about here!

Open-sourcing, as briefly discussed in Big Idea 1, allows for work to be freely shared, distributed, and modified. Open source is usually mentioned in the context of software.
Open access, on the other hand, refers to research available to the general public that's free of many restrictions.

Biased algorithms can misrepresent or exclude people, as seen above.
Some computing devices collect and analyze data through continuous monitoring of user activities. An example would be a step-tracker or screen-time tracker on your phone. This raises concerns about privacy and data use.
The digital divide itself also raises ethical concerns, for reasons covered above.

Computing devices also play a massive role in society and politics, and not always for the better.
The internet can be used to spread misinformation that could be harmful to people's health and well-being.

Age
Race
Phone Numbers
Medical information and biometric data (fingerprints, eye scans)
Financial Information
Social Security number
Scammers can also take advantage of keylogging technology, recording your keystrokes to gain access to sensitive information like passwords.
The information you send over public networks, like the Wifi network at a coffee store, has the potential to be intercepted by those with harmful ends. One of the ways this can happen is through a rogue access point, which gives unauthorized access to a secure network.

Authentication measures keep people from gaining unauthorized access to your accounts. We're going to look at two of them here: making a strong password and implementing a multi-factor authentication method.

Encryption, another way of protecting people's data, is the process of encoding data to prevent unwanted access.

We used an open source license so that it is accessible to the user AKA Derek's mom

Algorithms might also be trained on sets of data that aren't as diverse as they need to be. For example, facial recognition systems are often trained on data sets that contain fewer images of women and minorities than men in the majority.

Biases can be embedded at all levels of development, from the brainstorming phase to the work done after release.

Citizen science is a term that describes scientific research that the common population helps to conduct. Ordinary citizens help contribute data to research projects using computing devices.

Crowdsourcing is the practice of getting a large amount of input or information from people on the Internet. Citizen science is an example of crowdsourcing, but crowdsourcing can also take other forms.

Crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe, Kickstarter, and Patreon allow people to raise money for all manner of causes, from creating works of art to (unfortunately) funding medical bills.
